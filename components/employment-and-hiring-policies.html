<p><b>Early Intervention</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Employees are encouraged to address conflicts as soon as they arise to prevent escalation.</li>

</ol>
<p><b>Conflict Resolution Process</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Self-Resolution</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Employees are encouraged to resolve conflicts directly with the involved parties through open and respectful communication.</li>
<li>If self-resolution is successful, no further action is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Informal Resolution</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If self-resolution is not possible, employees should seek the assistance of their immediate supervisor or manager to facilitate an informal resolution.</li>
<li>The supervisor or manager will meet with the parties involved to discuss the issue and explore potential solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Formal Resolution</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If the conflict cannot be resolved informally, a formal resolution process will be initiated.</li>
<li>The employee should submit a written complaint to Human Resources, detailing the nature of the conflict, the parties involved, and any attempted resolutions.</li>
<li>Human Resources will conduct a thorough investigation, which may include interviews with the parties involved and any relevant witnesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mediation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, a neutral third party (mediator) may be brought in to facilitate a resolution.</li>
<li>Mediation is a voluntary process, and both parties must agree to participate.</li>
<li>The mediator will help the parties communicate more effectively and explore mutually acceptable solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Resolution and Follow-Up</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the investigation and/or mediation, Human Resources will recommend a resolution.</li>
<li>All parties involved will be informed of the resolution and any actions to be taken.</li>
<li>Human Resources will follow up to ensure the resolution is implemented and the conflict does not reoccur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Appeal Process</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If any party is not satisfied with the outcome of the conflict resolution process, they may appeal the decision.</li>
<li>Appeals must be submitted in writing to Human Resources within 10 business days of the resolution.</li>
<li>An independent review will be conducted by a senior management member or an external party, and a final decision will be made.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Prohibition of Retaliation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Retaliation against any employee for participating in the conflict resolution process is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>Any reports of retaliation will be investigated and addressed promptly.</li>
