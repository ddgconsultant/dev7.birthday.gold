A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to,\nsuch as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while\nproviding tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.\n\n## Features\n\nThe key features of Vault are:\n\n* **Secure Secret Storage**: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, Consul, and more.\n\n**Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.\n\n**Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as SQL without having to design their own encryption methods.\n\n**Leasing and Renewal**: All secrets in Vault have a lease associated with it. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.\n\n**Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.\n\n","minBoxVersion":"7.1.2","forumUrl":"https://forum.cloudron.io/category/94/vault","documentationUrl":"https://docs.cloudron.io/apps/vault/","healthCheckPath":"/","website":"https://www.vaultproject.io/","contactEmail":"support@cloudron.io","httpPort":8200,"addons":{"localstorage":{},"oidc":{"loginRedirectUri":"/ui/vault/auth/oidc/oidc/callback"}},"capabilities":["mlock"],"tags":["secret","encryption","hashicorp","password","key"],"manifestVersion":2,"memoryLimit":1073741824,"mediaLinks":["https://screenshots.cloudron.io/io.vaultproject.cloudronapp/vault-ui-wizard.png","../../screenshots.cloudron.io/io.vaultproject.cloudronapp/replicdation.html","https://screenshots.cloudron.io/io.vaultproject.cloudronapp/unseal.png"],"icon":"file://logo.png","postInstallMessage":"On first visit, you can generate the keys for the vault.

Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's transmitted over the Internet.\n\n### Features\n\n#### Secure & Private\n\n- **Private.** None of your data is ever stored anywhere else other than on your computers. There is no central server that might be compromised, legally or illegally.\n- **Encrypted.** All communication is secured using TLS. The encryption used includes perfect forward secrecy to prevent any eavesdropper from ever gaining access to your data.\n- **Authenticated.** Every node is identified by a strong cryptographic certificate. Only nodes you have explicitly allowed can connect to your cluster.\n\n#### Easy to Use\n\nSyncthing is still in development, although a large number of features have already been implemented:\n\n- **Web GUI.** Configure and monitor Syncthing via a responsive and powerful interface accessible via your browser.\n- **Portable.** Works on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and OpenBSD. Run it on your desktop computers and synchronize them with your server for backup.\n- **Simple.** Syncthing doesn't need IP addresses or advanced configuration: it just works, over LAN and over the Internet. Every machine is identified by an ID. Just give your ID to your friends, share a folder and watch: UPnP will do if you don't want to port forward or you don't know how.\n- **Powerful.** Synchronize as many folders as you need with different people.\n\n#### Native GUIs & Integrations\n\n- **Windows** tray utility, filesystem watcher & launcher: [SyncTrayzor](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/releases/latest)\n- **Cross-platform** GUI wrapper: [Syncthing-GTK](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-gtk/releases/latest)\n- **Android** app: [Syncthing App](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)\n","changelog":"* Update Syncthing to 1.27.4\n* [Full changelog](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases/tag/v1.27.4)\n* #9369: Panic in ignore matching on invalid UTF-8 from filesystem watcher\n* #9435: syncthing should be cgroup aware\n* #9339: File system watcher should skip ignored directories in more cases\n","tagline":"Decentralized file synchronization","version":"1.26.3","upstreamVersion":"1.27.4","healthCheckPath":"/healthcheck","httpPort":8000,"addons":{"localstorage":{},"ldap":{}},"tcpPorts":{"SYNC_PORT":{"title":"Sync Port","description":"Port over which syncthing will exchange data (do not disable)","defaultValue":22000,"containerPort":22000}},"manifestVersion":2,"website":"https://syncthing.net","contactEmail":"support@cloudron.io","icon":"logo.png","tags":["storage","sync"],"minBoxVersion":"7.1.2","forumUrl":"https://forum.cloudron.io/category/56/syncthing","documentationUrl":"https://docs.cloudron.io/apps/syncthing/","mediaLinks":["https://screenshots.cloudron.io/net.syncthing.cloudronapp2/1.png","../../screenshots.cloudron.io/net.syncthing.cloudronapp2/2.png","https://screenshots.cloudron.io/net.syncthing.cloudronapp2/3.png"],"optionalSso":true,"postInstallMessage":"<nosso>\nThis app is pre-setup with an account.

As long as you have access to a web browser, you have access to your machines.\n\n\n* Keep your desktop in the cloud - Desktops accessed through Guacamole need not physically exist. With both Guacamole and a desktop operating system hosted in the cloud, you can combine the convenience of Guacamole with the resilience and flexibility of cloud computing.\n\n\n* Free and open source - Apache Guacamole is and will always be free and open source software. It is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and is actively maintained by a community of developers that use Guacamole to access their own development environments. We feel this sets us apart from other remote desktop solutions, and gives us a distinct advantage.\n\n* Built on a well-documented API - Apache Guacamole is built on its own stack of core APIs which are thoroughly documented, including basic tutorials and conceptual overviews in the online manual. These APIs allow Guacamole to be tightly integrated into other applications, whether they be open source or proprietary.\n\n* Commercially supported - For enterprises, dedicated commercial support is also available through third party companies.\n\n## Supported Protocols\n\n * VNC protocol\n * RDP protocol (Remote Desktop)\n * SSH\n * Telnet\n\n","changelog":"* Update Guacamole to 1.5.4\n* [Release notes](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/1.5.4/#changelog)\n* History Recording Player should show controls when mouse is moved (GUACAMOLE-1872)\n* Control bar doesn’t auto-hide on history recording player (GUACAMOLE-1873)\n","tagline":"Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway.

Video load is reduced thanks to P2P in the web browser using WebTorrent or p2p-media-loader.\n\n## Features\n\n* Video streaming - Just upload your videos, and be sure they will stream anywhere. Add a description, some tags and your video will be discoverable by the entire video fediverse, not just your instance. You can even embed a player on your favorite website!\n\n* Keep in touch with video creators - Follow your favorite channels from PeerTube or really any other place. No need to have an account on the instance you watched a video to follow its author, you can do all of that from the Fediverse (Mastodon, Pleroma, and plenty others), or just with good ol' RSS.\n\n* An interface to call home - Be it as a user or an instance administrator, you can decide what your experience will be like. Don't like the colors? They are easy to change. Don't want to list videos of an instance but let your users subscribe to them? Don't like the regular web client? All of that can be changed, and much more. No UX dark pattern, no mining your data, no video recommendation bullshit™.\n\n* Communities that help each other - In addition to visitors using WebTorrent to share the load among them, instances can help each other by caching one another's videos. This way even small instances have a way to show content to a wider audience, as they will be shouldered by friend instances (more about that in our redundancy guide). Content creators can get help from their viewers in the simplest way possible: a support button showing a message linking to their donation accounts or really anything else.

When senders initialize a transfer,\nthey receive a \"tempalink\" they can distribute to recipients. Upon visiting this link,\nrecipients' browsers connect directly to the sender’s browser and may begin downloading\nthe selected file. Because data is never stored in an intermediary server, the transfer\nis fast, private, and secure.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Where are my files sent?** Your files never touch our server. Instead, they are sent\ndirectly from the uploader's browser to the downloader's browser using WebTorrent and WebRTC.\nThis requires that the uploader leave their browser window open until the transfer is complete.\n\n**Can multiple people download my file at once?** Yes!
