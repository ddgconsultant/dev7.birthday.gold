<h5 class="mt-5">Introduction</h5>
<p>These Terms and Conditions govern your use of the birthday.gold service and website. By signing up for and using our service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use our service.</p>


<h5 class="mt-5">Description of Service</h5>
<p>birthday.gold provides a convenient service that enables users to sign up and automatically enroll with the loyalty/rewards programs of various companies. Once signed up with birthday.gold, we handle the process of creating accounts and registering you for the rewards programs you've chosen. This service is designed to save you time and simplify the process of rewards program enrollment.</p>

<p>While our platform offers a streamlined and user-friendly way to join rewards programs, it's important to note that nothing prevents individuals from enrolling in these programs on their own. Our service is primarily about convenience and helping you to efficiently manage multiple loyalty program registrations.</p>

<p>Additionally, birthday.gold only enrolls users into new rewards programs, i.e., those where the user is not already a member. We do not update or manage memberships that a user has independently enrolled in outside of our platform. If you've previously joined a rewards program, any further management or updates related to that program should be handled directly with the respective company.</p>


<h5 class="mt-5">Relationship with Third Party Companies</h5>
<p>When you sign up for a company's rewards program through birthday.gold, your relationship for that program is directly between you and the third party company. birthday.gold simply facilitates the initial registration and acts as a registering agent on your behalf. Once enrolled, the terms and conditions for the individual rewards programs apply, not these Terms and Conditions. You agree to the individual third party terms and privacy policies.</p>

<p>Any claims, offers, or statements made by third party companies regarding their loyalty programs are solely between you and that company. birthday.gold shall not be held liable for any unfulfilled claims or offers made by any third party company.</p>

<p>birthday.gold is not responsible for managing or maintaining your accounts and relationships with any third party companies you are enrolled through our service.  Additionally, you agree to indemify, defend, and hold harmless from any damages or issues arising from the voluntary enrollment of the information you provided into any third party program or activity arising from the enrollment.</p>


<h5 class="mt-5">Fees</h5>
<p>birthday.gold charges a fee for facilitating plan specific features. All fees are disclosed prior to signing up for our service.  Due to the nature of our service, birthday.gold does not offer refunds for any fees paid.  The information regarding any loyalty program offers from third party businesses is provided free of charge.</p>


<h5 class="mt-5">Accounts and Passwords</h5>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your birthday.gold password and account information, as well as restricting access to your account. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.</p>


<h5 class="mt-5">Proper Use</h5>
<p>You agree not to use the birthday.gold service for any improper, fraudulent, or unlawful purpose. This includes causing intentional disruption to our service or attempting to register false or misleading user identities. Users who violate these terms may have their account terminated.</p>


<h5 class="mt-5">Age requirements</h5>
If you're under the age required to manage your own birthday.gold account, you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use a birthday.gold account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.  If you're a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you're responsible for your child's activity on our service.


<h5 class="mt-5">Termination</h5>   
<p>We reserve the right to terminate accounts or access to our service for any reason, including breach of these Terms and Conditions. You have the right to terminate your birthday.gold account at any time.  We also reserve the right to end any service offerings we provide including and up to the full service of birthday.gold.</p>
