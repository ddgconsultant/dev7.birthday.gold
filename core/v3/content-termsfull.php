<h5 class="mt-5">Service Description</h5>
<p>birthday.gold provides a convenient service that enables users to sign up and automatically register with the loyalty/rewards programs of various businesses. Once signed up with birthday.gold, we handle the process of creating accounts and enrolling you for the rewards programs you've chosen. This service is designed to save you time and simplify the process of rewards program enrollment.</p>

<p>While our platform offers a streamlined and user-friendly way to join rewards programs, it's important to note that nothing prevents individuals from enrolling in these programs on their own. Our service is primarily about convenience and helping you to efficiently manage multiple loyalty program registrations.</p>

<p>Additionally, birthday.gold only enrolls users into new rewards programs, i.e., those where the user is not already a member. We do not update or manage memberships that a user has independently enrolled in outside of our platform. If you've previously joined a rewards program, any further management or updates related to that program should be handled directly with the respective company.  After the enrollment process is completed for any business that you, the User has selected, you are the sole owner of that third-party account and are bound to the terms and conditions set forth by the third-party business(es).  Nothing in the service we provide waives those terms, policies, and or requirement of the third-party business(es).</p>
